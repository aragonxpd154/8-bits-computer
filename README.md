This is a small 8-bit computer that I'm developing with a bus and some basic peripherals, with little use in the current technological context, it's a more hobbyist and simplistic project like many projects that exist on the internet.
No SoC's or microcontrollers, everything will be done like the old days without microcontrollers like Z80 or Atmega! The goal is to create a computer as abstract as possible, for educational purposes, however nothing prevents it from being used in production.

## :rocket: Technologies

This project is still in the development stage and using the following technologies

-  [Hexplorer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hexplorer/files/)
-  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-  [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/)
-  [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)

## :information_source: How To Use

This project directory contains a folder with its respective version (in a subfolder), the electronic schematic and the layout of the printed circuit board (PCB) and compiled code, which is specific to each function of the 8bit computer.

Always check and/or use the highest numbered version or most recent modification described in the commit for example:

Old version: 
```bash
...directory...\1.0V
````

latest version: 
```bash
...directory...\2.1V 
````

To clone and download all project directories you can use [Git](https://git-scm.com), or any other specific program.

To clone the current directory use the command:
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/aragonxpd154/8-bits-computer
````

## â˜• Do It Yourself

As soon as I finish all the branches of this project I will make available a final version of the package with a detailed description for you to be able to assemble your own 8bit computer. Only a pre-release version was available, with the passing of these months I should provide a more complete version.

## :status:ðŸ’» Development Status

The revision of all the directories of this project has already started, with each commit I will be providing a description of what was changed in each revision. The review process is below:

- [ ] Reviewer ACC REGISTER 
- [ ] Reviewer ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT
- [ ] Reviewer ASSEMBLY LAYOUT
- [ ] Reviewer ASTABLE AND MONOSTABLE CLOCK CIRCUIT
- [ ] Reviewer B REGISTER
- [ ] Reviewer CONTROL DECODER
- [ ] Reviewer DECIMAL DISPLAY
- [ ] Reviewer FETCH EXECUTION COUNTER
- [ ] Reviewer INSTRUCTION REGISTER
- [ ] Reviewer OUTPUT REGISTER
- [ ] Reviewer PROGRAM COUNTER
- [ ] Reviewer RAM & MAR
- [ ] Reviewer RESERT CIRCUIT

Below are the tests of each board (PCB) after production. The review directory is [REHEARSAL](https://github.com/aragonxpd154/8-bits-computer/tree/main/~REHEARSAL~)

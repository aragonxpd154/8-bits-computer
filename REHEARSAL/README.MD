**Rehearsal**
===============================

Description 
-------

In this tab, you will find the tests of each circuit board and its components in the project, such as time and frequency domain measurements and other related things relevant to the project.

[**ASTABLE AND MONSTABLE CLOCK CIRCUIT**](https://github.com/aragonxpd154/8-bit-computer/tree/main/REHEARSAL/ASTABLE%20AND%20MONSTABLE%20CLOCK%20CIRCUIT)
    
    Tests involving the clock circuit were very promising, however it is suggested to include tantalum-type capacitors to avoid external noise
